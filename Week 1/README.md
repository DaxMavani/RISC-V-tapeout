## My Experience

Week 1 is here! I must say that it wasn’t as easy as it seemed for other people (I guess).  
I had never used Git before, let alone Linux, and installing Ubuntu through a virtual machine felt like a huge challenge. It was all chaos at first — after countless errors and hours of debugging even simple concepts, I felt embarrassed, but I never gave up.  

Eventually, I found my way through the tasks and completed them!

## Gratitude & Growth

I am grateful that I at least took a step forward with this program. Already, I can feel myself becoming a better version — more confident and capable.  

Looking forward to the next week and the challenges it will bring!
