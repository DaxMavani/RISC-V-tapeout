Welcome to my first ever repositroy and through the program **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
With this repository on GitHub I aim to document all of my journey through posting my **Week by Week** progress which will show my consistency throughout and ensure to the viewers as well that i have acheived progress here...   

"This program is a step forward towards the vision Of **Viksit Bharat** and **The Dream Of Semiconductor Industry** in India. Here, to give a consice summary, we will be looking towards the RTL to GDSII fllow of VLSI and this will enable us to have a deeper understanding of the physical design flow of how an IC/Chip is made"
